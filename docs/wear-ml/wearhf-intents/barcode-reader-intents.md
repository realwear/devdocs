# Barcode Reader Intents

The RealWear Device comes with a built in barcode reader app which is fully optimized for voice command control.

Scan a barcode
If you need to scan a barcode for your app use the following intent.

`com.realwear.barcodereader.intent.action.SCAN_BARCODE`

## Extras

\* If no symbology intent extras are passed, or if all symbology intent extras are set to false then all available symbology types will be accepted by the barcode reader.
