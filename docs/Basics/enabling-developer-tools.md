# Enabling Developer Tools

Realwear devices ship by default with ADB enabled, but the developer tools disabled. As this is an Android device, enabling these tools is easy, But there is a catch. The standard method of activating developer tools on Android still applies, but as our devices are completely handsfree we would recommend using a screen mirroring tool such as the one bundled in [RealWear Explorer](../downloads/realwear-explorer.md) to perform this task.

Once you have developer tools and USB Debugging enabled on the device, you can run your app from your IDE as you would for any other device. You can choose to then drive it by wearing the headset by using the voice commands or by using [RealWear Explorer](../downloads/realwear-explorer.md) to use your keyboard and mouse to drive the experience.
