# Show Help Intents

The RealWear Device has a global Show Help voice command that the user can use at any point to discover the options they have available to them. This function ensures that they never feel lost as they can quickly find the voice commands that may not be immediately obvious to them.
The device also displays a Show Help button permanently on the screen so the user always has help available if they ever get stuck.

WearHF provides some intents that allow your app to change the default functionality of the Show Help button and menu.

## Showing and hiding the Show Help button

If you do not want the Show Help button to be displayed inside your app, it is possible to hide it using the following intent.
