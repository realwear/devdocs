# Language Support

The voice recognition engine that comes pre-installed on all RealWear Devices is multi-lingual. Some languages come preinstalled on the device, whilst others have to be enabled and sent to the device through RealWear Cloud.
However, if you want to limit your devices to only a few languages you can use our language selection tool in RealWear Cloud. This can add or remove languages from the devices or allow a smaller selection set to simplify setup and usage for the users.

Below is a table that shows all supported languages and what firmware version they are available in.

:::note

Only US English, German and Mandarin are supported for offline dictation
