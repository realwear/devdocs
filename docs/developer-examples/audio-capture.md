# Audio Capture

## Development Example

Audio is delivered to applications using the standard Android mechanisms, so an application that records audio should work out of the box on the RealWear Device.

It is possible to record audio in mono or stereo at the following sample rates:

- 8KHz
- 16KHz
- 44KHz
- 48KHz

The WearHF service handles microphone selection automatically and audio delivered to an application after the HMT has preformed noise cancellation, so an application simply needs to record from the microphone.

```java
int bufferSize = AudioRecord.getMinBufferSize(
    mSampleRate, monoOrStereo, AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_16BIT
);

AudioRecord audioRecorder = new AudioRecord(
    MediaRecorder.AudioSource.MIC,
    8000, // Sample rate
    AudioFormat.CHANNEL_IN_STEREO,
    AudioFormat.ENCODING_PCM_16BIT,
    bufferSize
);

audioRecorder.startRecording();
```
